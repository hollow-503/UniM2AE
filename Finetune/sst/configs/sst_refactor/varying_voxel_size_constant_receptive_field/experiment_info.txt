We do trials with constant effective window size (receptive field), and varies voxel sizes. Thus, the window shape will also vary.
We perform the initial trials with 2 merged sweeps, and remove the close points up to 2 meters from the car.
Using 2 merged sweeps to stay constant with resent trials, though we could also investigate other merge sizes whenever we have merged all our branches to main.

We have a receptive field equivalent to 0.25*16=4m.

We decreased the batch size from 4 to 2 when we have have voxel size of 0.1. Though it crashed also with batch size 2.

We will decrease the batch size from 4 to 1 when considering all classes and we have have voxel size of 0.1.
